# Vector test
## Procedure
Change vector_test.cpp to main.cpp and move it to /src.
## Test output
```bash
[1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9] (expected: [5,7,9])
[1,2,3] - [4,5,6] = [-3,-3,-3] (expected: [-3,-3,-3])
[1,2,3] · [4,5,6] = 32 (expected: 32)
[1,2,3] × [4,5,6] = [-3,6,-3] (expected: [-3,6,-3])
[1,2,3] * 1.5 = [1.5,3,4.5] (expected: [1.5,3,4.5])
1.5 * [4,5,6] = [6,7.5,9] (expected: [6,7.5,9])
```
